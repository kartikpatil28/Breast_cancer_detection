A machine learning project for **early and accurate breast cancer detection** using the [Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29). This repository features an end-to-end workflow inside a single Jupyter/Colab notebook, including thorough data exploration, visualization, multiple classifiers, and performance comparison.

## ✨ Features

- 📊 **Interactive Data Visualization:** Feature analysis, correlations and detailed EDA plots.
- 🔎 **Multiple ML Algorithms:** SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and KNN implemented and compared.
- 🏆 **Performance Metrics:** Includes confusion matrix, classification reports, metric plots.
- 📈 **Intuitive Workflow:** Easy to follow, with stepwise explanations and outputs.
- ☁️ **Colab Ready:** No setup needed – just open in Google Colab and run!
